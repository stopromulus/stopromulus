Hello! :) 

My name is Rome and I recently switched into Computer Science. I hope to become a software engineer and web developer with any opportunities that come along. 

Most of my experience is in HTML + CSS when I took Web Design in high school.

I'm currently learning:
- Python
- Django
- Svelte
- Tailwind CSS
